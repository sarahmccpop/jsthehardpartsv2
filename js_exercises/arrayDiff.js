// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, 
// which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

function arrayDiff(a, b) {

    return megalength = a.length + b.length
    for (let i = 0; i <megalength; i++){
        if a.includes[i] && b.includes[i]{
            a.
        }
    }
  
}
console.log(arrayDiff([1,1],[1]))
